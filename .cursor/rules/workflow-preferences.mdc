# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
– Сheck the implementation's functionality thoroughly before considering it complete and notifying me about it
– Test your implementation's functionality until it works as expected and make absolutely sure that there are no errors in console before considering it complete and terminating the implementation process
